Anthoney is a Front-End Web Developer who
is able to fluently merge design and coding with the art of programming. 
He translates our UI/UX design wireframes into working HTML/CSS and JS
for our applications. 
He knows enough to act as proxy between visual design and technical implementation,
and is intimately involved at all stages that affect the
look and behaviour of our applications.

Shauna speaks Python like a pro. As our senior Python Web Developer she ensures
all the server-side logic works properly.
Shauna takes the front-end elements and integrates them with our backend systems.
